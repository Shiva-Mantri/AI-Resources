## Containers and Kubernetes
#### Basics and Architecture
- https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/getting-started-with-kubernetes-part1/
- https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/getting-started-with-kubernetes-part2/
- https://phoenixnap.com/kb/understanding-kubernetes-architecture-diagrams

#### Containers – Provides ability to abstract software from infrastructure
- Docker, RKT, MS Hyper-v and Windows containers
- https://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/container-platforms/container-engines/
- https://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/container-platforms/container-platforms-6-best-practices-and-15-top-solutions/
 
#### Container Orchestrators – Provides ability to manage the swarm of containers
- Kubernetes (K8s), Docker Swarm, Nomad, K3s+k3d (for running K8s on VM and Docker respectively on local machine)
- Kubernetes - https://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-complete-guide/
- Can be Container-as-a-Service (AWS Fargate), Managed (AWS EKS), Platform-as-a-Service (RH OpenShift) or Light Weight (Docker Swarm)
- Alternatives - https://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-alternatives/
 
#### Container Management Platforms – Provides ability to deliver and manage Kubernetes Infrastructure
- RH OpenShift Container Platform, VMWare Tanzu, Google Anthos, Rancher
 
#### Advanced
- Docker and Kubernetes is a rabbit hole. That is a whole stack altogether. K8s and its management is a full time job role and involves strategy, setup and operation.
