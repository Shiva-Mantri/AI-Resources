## INTRODUCTION TO AI

### News/Blogs
- https://www.zillow.com/tech/
- https://ai.facebook.com/

#### Tip
- Focus on this or any other learning plan and STICK with it. 
- Create a mini milestone map. e.g. each milestone should be a week or 15 days long. 
- This will help in staying on track and not get distracted by new/alternate resources.

- https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/getting-started-with-kubernetes-part2/
- https://phoenixnap.com/kb/understanding-kubernetes-architecture-diagrams

##### Containers – Provides ability to abstract software from infrastructure
- Docker, RKT, MS Hyper-v and Windows containers
- https://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/container-platforms/container-engines/
- https://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/container-platforms/container-platforms-6-best-practices-and-15-top-solutions/
 
##### Container Orchestrators – Provides ability to manage the swarm of containers
- Kubernetes (K8s), Docker Swarm, Nomad, K3s+k3d (for running K8s on VM and Docker respectively on local machine)
- Kubernetes - https://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-complete-guide/
- Can be Container-as-a-Service (AWS Fargate), Managed (AWS EKS), Platform-as-a-Service (RH OpenShift) or Light Weight (Docker Swarm)
- Alternatives - https://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-alternatives/
 
##### Container Management Platforms – Provides ability to deliver and manage Kubernetes Infrastructure
- RH OpenShift Container Platform, VMWare Tanzu, Google Anthos, Rancher
 
##### Advanced
- Docker and Kubernetes is a rabbit hole. That is a whole stack altogether. K8s and its management is a full time job role and involves strategy, setup and operation.
- You can learn this topic in depth if this is the field you need/want to be in. Otherwise, focus your energy in your primary area of interest and limit scope of this topic to basics.

#### Tips
- Searching for job opening and other ML professions' advice. More from source: http://aiflavours.com/data-science-faq/
> One of the reasons for that, in my opinion, is that companies often choose the most popular job name which is widely searchable by candidates. Then they put the responsibilities which they see fit for their purposes. This is why you shouldn't close yourself to the opportunities just because the job’s name is not exactly right - rather ask the company precisely about the responsibilities.
